	annote = {A new proposed method, i.e. the recurrent neural network (RNN), is introduced to predict chaotic time series. The effectiveness of using RNN for making one-step and multi-step predictions is tested based on remarkable few datum points by computer-generated chaotic time series. Numerical results show that the RNN proposed here is a very powerful tool for making prediction of chaotic time series.}
